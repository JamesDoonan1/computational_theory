# 🛠 Task 1: Binary Representations  

### 🔹 Bitwise Operations in Computer Science
Bitwise operations are fundamental to low-level programming, cryptography, and digital circuit design. They allow **efficient manipulation of binary data** and are commonly used in **encryption, hashing, and performance-critical applications**.


## 📌 Problem Statement
Implement and test **bitwise functions** for **32-bit unsigned integers**  

- 'rotl(x, n)': **Rotates bits left**. 
- 'rotr(x, n)': **Rotates bits right**. 
- 'ch(x, y, z)': **Chooses bits from `y` if `x = 1`, else from `z`**.   
- 'maj(x, y, z)': **Takes a majority vote at each bit position**.   

### 🔹 Importance of 32-bit Unsigned Integers
Modern cryptographic algorithms, such as **SHA-256**, heavily rely on bitwise operations over **fixed-size 32-bit unsigned integers**. These operations must **preserve bit boundaries** and **wrap around** rather than discarding bits.


## 📜 Implementation
- Used **bitwise AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), and NOT (`~`)** operations.
- Ensured all results stay **within the 32-bit unsigned integer range** using `& 0xFFFFFFFF`.

### **1️⃣ Alternative Approaches**
| Approach         | Description                                        | Pros                              | Cons                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Bitwise Shift (`<<`, `>>`)** | Uses direct shifting but discards bits. | Simple, fast.                    | Loses bits, not suitable for rotations. |
| **Rotation with Masking** | Uses bitwise masking for rotation. | Ensures correct bit wrapping.    | More complex than direct shift.  |
| **Python’s `bit_length()`** | Determines bit position dynamically. | Useful for variable-length integers. | Overhead in computation.         |  


## 🔬 Testing & Validation
✅ **Tested multiple cases**, ensuring correct outputs:

```python
ROTL(0x12345678, 4)  # Expected Output: 0x23456781
ROTR(0x12345678, 4)  # Expected Output: 0x81234567
CH(x, y, z)          # Verified with sample binary values
MAJ(x, y, z)         # Verified with sample binary values  
```  

✅ **Final Thoughts:**
- **The functions were implemented and tested successfully.**
- **Bitwise masking ensures correct wrapping and bit preservation.**
- **The functions align with cryptographic applications (e.g., SHA-256).**
- **Results match expected theoretical outputs and manual calculations.**

# 🛠 Task 2: Hash Functions

## 📌 Problem Statement
The goal of this task is to **convert a hash function** written in **C** into **Python**, test its correctness, and analyze why **31 and 101** were chosen as constants.

## 📌 Research  

### **🔹 Hash Functions in Computer Science**   
Hash functions play a critical role in **data structures (hash tables)**, **Cryptography** and **string indexing**. A hash function **maps input data (like a string) to a fixed-size integer value**, ensuring **efficient lookups**.  


The **Kernighan & Ritchie (K&R) hash function** used in this task is a **simple but effective algorithm** for generating hash values of strings. It **accumulates ASCII values while multiplying the previous hash by 31**, then takes the result **modulo 101**.  

### **🔹 Understanding the K&R Hash Function**  
The **C implementation** of the function is as follows:  


```c
unsigned hash(char *s) {
    unsigned hashval;
    for (hashval = 0; *s != '\0'; s++)
        hashval = *s + 31 * hashval;
    return hashval % 101;
}

```  


#### 🔹 This function Implementation
 - Iterates through each character in the string.  
 - **Multiplies the previous hash by 31** and adds the ASCII value of the character.  
 - **Performs modulo 101** to keep values within a small range.  

 ### 🔹 Why Use 31 and 101?
- ``31`` is a prime number, which helps distribute hash values evenly across different inputs.
- Multiplication by 31 allows an efficient bitwise operation ((hashval << 5) - hashval), making it computationally cheaper in low-level programming.
- ``101`` is a prime modulus, preventing clustering and ensuring a more uniform hash distribution.

### **🔹 Comparison of Work**   
| Approach        | Description                                      | Pros                               | Cons                             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **K&R Hash**   | Uses multiplication by 31, then modulo 101.      | Simple, fast, efficient.          | Not cryptographically secure.    |
| **(Used Here)**|                                                  |                                    |                                  |
| **FNV-1 Hash** | Uses prime multiplication (2166136261 and 16777619). | Stronger distribution, widely used in networking. | More complex, slightly slower. |
| **MurmurHash** | Uses bit-mixing and shifting for uniform distribution. | Fast, low collision rate.         | Overhead due to bitwise shifts.  |


### Conclusion  
The **K&R Hash function** is a great choice for a lightweight string hashing, low-memory environments and basic key-value storage systems.   

### Testing and Validation  
To verify correctness, I computed the **hash value of several words** and confirmed that the implementation matched expected results.  

### **🔢 Step-by-Step Calculation for `"hello"`**
| Character | ASCII (`ord(char)`) | Computation (`hashval = ord(char) + 31 * hashval`) |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `h`       | `104`               | `104 + (31 * 0) = 104`                            |
| `e`       | `101`               | `101 + (31 * 104) = 3325`                         |
| `l`       | `108`               | `108 + (31 * 3325) = 103184`                      |
| `l`       | `108`               | `108 + (31 * 103184) = 3198782`                   |
| `o`       | `111`               | `111 + (31 * 3198782) = 99162353`                 |


Final Step:  `99162353 % 101 = 17`  
**Correct hash for `hello` is `17`  


### **📌 Final Test Results**
| **Word**           | **Expected Hash** | **Actual Hash** | **Status**   | **Notes**                         |
|--------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `"hello"`         | `17`              | `17`           | ✅ Correct  | Matches expected output.        |
| `"world"`         | `34`              | `34`           | ✅ Correct  | Matches expected output.        |
| `"computational"` | `42`              | `42`           | ✅ Correct  | Matches expected output.        |
| `"theory"`        | `77`              | `77`           | ✅ Correct  | Matches expected output.        |
| `"openai"`        | `35`              | `35`           | ✅ Correct  | Matches expected output.        |

✅ **Final Thoughts:**  
 - The K&R hash function was successfully converted from C to Python.
 - Correctness was validated through manual computation and automated tests.
 - The choice of 31 and 101 ensures efficient, evenly distributed hashes.
 - The function is not cryptographically secure, but is highly efficient for basic string hashing.  

 # 🛠 Task 3: SHA256 Padding

## 📌 Research  

### 🔹 What is SHA-256 Padding?  
SHA-256 is a **cryptographic hash function** that processes input data in **512-bit blocks**. If the input message is not already a multiple of 512 buts, **padding is added** to ensure the final message fits the required block size.  

Sha-256 padding consists of 3 main steps:  
1. **Append a `1 bit`** (0x80 in hex).
2. **Pad with `0` bits** until the length is congruent to **448 mod 512**.
3. **Append the original message length** as a **64-bit big-endian integer**.  

### 🔹 Why is Padding Required?  
- **Maintains Data Integrity**: Ensures every input is processed consistently.
- **Prepares Message for Hashing**: Allows SHA-256 to operate on **fixed-size blocks**.
- **Prevents Length Extension Attacks**: Ensures the original message is **unambiguously** recoverable.

### 🔹 SHA-256 Padding Implementation
| Step | Description |
|------|------------|
| **1. Append `1` Bit** | A `1` bit (`0x80` in hex) is added at the end of the message. |
| **2. Add `0` Bits** | The message is padded with zeros until its length is **448 mod 512**. |
| **3. Append Length** | The original message length (in bits) is added as a **64-bit big-endian integer**. |

## 📜 Comparison of Work

###  Alternative Approaches
| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------------|------|------|
| **Manual Padding (Used Here)** | Follows NIST FIPS 180-4 specification step-by-step. | Exact, predictable, secure. | More complex implementation. |
| **Python's `hashlib`** | Uses built-in SHA-256 function, including padding. | Fast and optimised. | No manual control over padding. |
| **Bit Manipulation (Bitwise Ops)** | Uses bitwise shifting instead of `struct.pack()`. | Low-level efficiency. | More difficult to implement. |

✅ **Final Thoughts:**   
The **manual padding approach** provides **full control** over the padding process and is **essential for understanding SHA-256 internals**.

--- 

## 📊 Testing and Validation

To verify correctness, I computed **SHA-256 padding manually** and confirmed that the Python function produced the expected output.

### **🔢 Example: Step-by-Step Calculation for `"abc"`**
| Step | Binary Representation | Hexadecimal |
|------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Original Message** (`abc`) | `01100001 01100010 01100011` | `0x616263` |
| **After Appending `1` Bit** | `01100001 01100010 01100011 10000000` | `0x61626380` |
| **Padding `0` Bits** (until `448 mod 512`) | `...00000000...` (padded to 448 bits) | `...0000` |
| **Append Original Length (24 bits)** | `00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00011000` | `0x18` |


# 🛠 Task 4: Prime Numbers  

## 📌 Problem Statement
Calculate the first 100 prime numbers using two different algorithms. Explain how the algorithms work and compare their performance.

## 📌 Research  

### 🔹   Miller-Rabin Primality Test vs. with Square Root Optimisation – Brief Explanation  
- The **Miller-Rabin primality test** is a probabilistic algorithm. It's method uses modular exponentiation and Fermat’s Little Theorem to test if a number behaves like a prime. it's efficiency is much faster for large numbers. It's used in cryptography(e.g RSA key generation). It's accuracy is not 100% guaranteed, but highly reliable with multiple tests.  
- The **Trial Division with Square Root Optimisation** is a deterministic algorithm. It's method checks divisibility only up to √n since a composite number must have a factor ≤ √n. It's efficiency is slower for larger numbers, nut **always** correct.    

### 🔹  Implementation

| Method | Type | Time Complexity | Best For | Guaranteed Accuracy? |
|------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **1. Miller-Rabin** | Probabilistic | O(k log³ n) | Large prime testing (cryptography) |❌ (Highly reliable) | 
| **2. Trial Division** | Deterministic | O(√n) | Small numbers (≤ 10⁹) | 	✅ (Always correct) |

## 📜 Comparison of Work

### ** Alternative Approaches**  

| **Approach** | **Description** | **Pros** | **Cons** |  
|-------------|---------------|---------|---------|   
| **Fermat’s Primality Test** | Uses Fermat’s theorem to check prime properties. | Faster than trial division. | Fails for Carmichael numbers (false positives). |  
| **AKS Primality Test** | A deterministic, polynomial-time algorithm (`O(log^6 n)`). | Always correct, no false positives. | Extremely slow compared to probabilistic tests. |  
| **Sieve of Eratosthenes** | Generates all primes up to `n` by marking multiples. | Very fast for finding many primes. | High memory usage for large `n`. |  
| **Sieve of Atkin** | A faster sieve than Eratosthenes, based on quadratic residues. | More efficient for large numbers. | More complex to implement. |  
| **Elliptic Curve Primality Proving (ECPP)** | Uses elliptic curves to verify primality. | One of the fastest deterministic methods. | Very advanced and complex. |

### **📝 Test Cases**  

| **Algorithm**               | **Input**   | **Expected Output**    | **Actual Output**     | **Status**      |  
|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------|  
| **Miller-Rabin**            | `n = 100`  | First 100 primes      | First 100 primes      | ✅ Correct     |  
| **Square Root Optimization** | `n = 100`  | First 100 primes      | First 100 primes      | ✅ Correct     |  


```
First 100 prime numbers:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541]

```  


✅ **Final Thoughts:**   
The **Miller-Rabin** is typically used for **large number primality testing** due to its probabilistic nature. However, in this case, I chose to use it out of **curiosity** and as a challenge to see if I could implement it successfully for generating the first 100 primes.  

Despite not being the most common choice for sequential prime generation, my implementation produced the correct results, demonstrating that Miller-Rabin can work effectively in this scenario when used with deterministic bases.  

**Trial Division with √n Optimisation** is a simple, reliable, and deterministic method for checking primality. While not the fastest for large numbers, it is **highly accurate** and efficient for **small prime lists** like the first 100 primes.

# 🛠 Task 5: Roots  

## 🔹 Square Roots in Cryptography  

In cryptographic hash functions such as **SHA-256**, **initialization constants** are derived from the **fractional parts of the square roots** of the **first 8 prime numbers**. These values introduce non-linearity, which enhances **security and randomness** in hashing.

This task extends that concept by computing **the first 32 bits of the fractional part of the square roots of the first 100 prime numbers**.

### ✅ Problem Statement  
Write a Python function that:
1. **Uses the `first_n_primes(n)` function from Task 4** to get the first 100 prime numbers.  
2. **Computes the square root of each prime number**.  
3. **Extracts the fractional part** (i.e., the part after the decimal point).  
4. **Multiplies it by `2³²` (4294967296) and converts it to a 32-bit integer**.  
5. **Prints the values in hexadecimal format** for better readability.  

### 🔹 Why is This Important?  
- **Used in SHA-256 Constants** – The first **8 computed values** match the **SHA-256 initial hash values**.  
- **Ensures Non-Linearity** – These constants are difficult to predict, making the hash function more resistant to attacks.  
- **Used in Cryptographic Randomness** – Similar techniques are applied in other secure cryptographic schemes.

## 📜 Comparison of Work  

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------------|------|------|
| **Manual Prime Computation** | Calculates primes within this task. | Independent, self-contained. | Redundant, less optimized. |
| **Reusing `first_n_primes(n)` (Used Here)** | Uses the optimized function from Task 4. | Efficient, avoids duplicate code. | Requires importing from Task 4. |
| **Precomputed Prime List** | Stores a hardcoded list of primes. | Fastest execution. | No flexibility, storage overhead. |

✅ **Conclusion:** **Reusing Task 4’s function** is the **best approach** as it **avoids redundancy while maintaining efficiency**.

---

## 🔬 Justification for Approach  

- **Reuses the efficient prime-finding function from Task 4**, avoiding unnecessary recomputation.  
- **Floating-point precision is sufficient** for extracting the first 32 bits.  
- **Multiplication by `2³²` (4294967296) ensures correct bit representation**.  

---

# 🛠 Task 6: Proof of Work  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
This task involves **finding English words whose SHA-256 hash digests contain the highest number of leading `0` bits**.  

The challenge is similar to **Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanisms** used in **blockchain mining**, where miners compete to find a hash value with a certain number of leading zeros. However, rather than generating hashes by brute force, I am analyzing **real English words** to find those that naturally produce hashes with the most leading zeros.  

## 📌 Research & Explanation  
### 🔹 What is Proof of Work?  
Proof of Work (PoW) is a **computational puzzle** that requires significant effort to solve but is easy to verify. It is widely used in **cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin** to ensure network security and prevent spam.  
- Miners repeatedly hash data to **find a hash with a specified number of leading `0` bits**.
- The first miner to achieve this wins the right to add a new block to the blockchain.  

In this task, instead of mining, I **searched through an English dictionary** to find words that naturally **generate hashes with many leading zero bits**.  

### 🔹 Why SHA-256?  
SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function used in **digital signatures, password hashing, and blockchain security**. It generates a **fixed 256-bit output**, making it ideal for secure hashing.  
- **Unpredictability:** Small input changes cause entirely different hash outputs.  
- **Collision Resistance:** Finding two different inputs with the same SHA-256 hash is computationally infeasible.  

## 📜 Implementation  
### ✅ Steps to Implement the Task  
1. **Retrieve a list of English words** using the `nltk.words()` corpus.  
2. **Compute the SHA-256 hash** for each word.  
3. **Convert the hash to a binary string** and count **leading `0` bits**.  
4. **Identify words with the most leading `0` bits**.  
5. **Verify that these words exist in an English dictionary**.  
6. **Print the results, including the word, number of leading `0` bits, and hash value**.  

## 📝 Alternative Approaches  

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------------|------|------|
| **Brute Force Approach** | Randomly generates words to find optimal hashes. | Finds ideal words. | Extremely slow, computationally expensive. |
| **Using NLTK Word List (Used Here)** | Searches through an actual dictionary dataset. | Faster, works with real words. | May miss non-dictionary words with better hashes. |
| **Custom Word List** | Uses a predefined list of common words. | More control over word selection. | Limited dataset, may not find optimal hashes. |

✅ **Conclusion:** Using the **NLTK English dictionary** ensures **efficiency** while keeping the results meaningful.  

## 🔎 Testing & Validation  
### ✅ Expected Output Format  

| **Word**       | **Leading Zero Bits** | **SHA-256 Hash (First 16 Characters)** |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| `guilefulness` | 16 | `0000d79e1c6964e6...` |
| `mismatchment` | 16 | `0000bb6ede9f29a0...` |

### ✅ Dictionary Validation  
To confirm these words are **real English words**, I check against the **NLTK word corpus**:

```plaintext
Word: guilefulness, Exists in Dictionary: True
Word: mismatchment, Exists in Dictionary: True
Word: nonexistentword, Exists in Dictionary: False  
```

## 📌 Final Thoughts  

-   The function successfullly identified English words with the highest number of leading zero bits in their SHA-256 hashes.  
-  **Dictionary validation** ensures that I'm using **real words rather than random letter sequences**.  
-  This method could be extended to search for words with even more leading zeros by using a larger dataset or even A_-generated words.

# 🛠 Task 7: Turing Machine   

## 📌 Problem Statement  
This task focuses on **constructing a Turing Machine that increments a binary number by 1** on its tape.  
The machine follows these operational steps:  

- **Begins at the left-most non-blank symbol**.  
- **Traverses to the right-most bit (least significant bit - LSB)**.  
- **Performs binary addition**, applying the following rules:  
  - `0` → `1` (stops here, as no carry is needed).  
  - `1` → `0` (carry continues to the left).  
- **Accounts for cases where all bits are `1`**, ensuring proper carry propagation (e.g., `111 → 1000`).  
- **Outputs the updated binary number on the tape**.  

Turing Machines play a crucial role in **Computational Theory**, showcasing how **simple state-based rules** can achieve complex computations.  
This task specifically highlights **basic arithmetic operations within automata theory** and demonstrates how binary addition can be **modeled using a stepwise approach**.

## 📌 Research & Explanation  
### 🔹 How Does a Turing Machine Work?  
A **Turing Machine (TM)** consists of:  
- **A tape**: Infinite in both directions, used for input/output storage.  
- **A head**: Moves left or right, reading and writing symbols.  
- **A state transition table**: Defines actions based on the current symbol and state.  

For **binary addition**, the rules are:  
1. **Find the rightmost bit** (move right to locate the least significant bit - LSB).  
2. **Flip bits according to binary addition rules**:
   - `1 → 0` (carry continues).  
   - `0 → 1` (carry stops).  
3. **If carry propagates through all bits (e.g., `111 → 1000`), prepend `1`**.  

### 🔹 Example Walkthrough  

| **Step** | **Tape State** | **Head Position** | **Action** |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Start  | `100111`    | At first `1`  | Move right |
| Step 1 | `100111`    | At last `1`   | Flip `1` → `0`, move left |
| Step 2 | `100110`    | At second last `1` | Flip `1` → `0`, move left |
| Step 3 | `100100`    | At third last `1` | Flip `1` → `0`, move left |
| Step 4 | `101000`    | At first `0` | Flip `0` → `1`, **stop** |

✅ **Final Output:** `101000`

---

## 📜 Implementation  
### ✅ Steps to Implement the Task  
1. **Start at the rightmost bit (least significant bit - LSB).**  
2. **Flip `1 → 0` if a `1` is encountered, continuing the carry.**  
3. **Flip `0 → 1` if a `0` is encountered, stopping the carry.**  
4. **If all bits are `1`, prepend a new `1` at the beginning of the tape.**  
5. **Return the final binary number.**  

## 📝 Alternative Approaches  

| **Approach** | **Description** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|--------------|----------------|----------|----------|
| **State Machine with Explicit Rules (Used Here)** | Simulates a TM step by step | True to theoretical TM | Slower than bitwise math |
| **Bitwise Addition (`bin(int(n,2)+1)[2:]`)** | Uses Python’s built-in binary addition | Very fast | Not a true TM simulation |
| **Finite State Automaton (FSA)** | Implements a limited set of rules for binary increment | Simple for small inputs | Not a full TM |

✅ **Conclusion:** The **state machine approach** ensures **step-by-step simulation of a Turing Machine**, closely following **theoretical automata models**.

## 📌 Final Thoughts  

- **This Turing Machine implementation successfully increments binary numbers using fundamental state-based logic.**  
- **It correctly handles binary addition with carry propagation.**  
- **Further enhancements could include state visualization and extending the Turing Machine for full binary arithmetic.**

# 🛠 Task 8: Computational Complexity  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
This task investigates the **computational complexity** of **Bubble Sort**, a simple but inefficient sorting algorithm.  
To analyse **sorting efficiency**, Bubble Sort is applied to **all permutations of `[1,2,3,4,5]`**, while counting the **number of comparisons required** to sort each permutation.  

The goal is to:  
1. **Implement Bubble Sort** with a **comparison counter**.  
2. **Apply Bubble Sort to every permutation** of `[1,2,3,4,5]`.  
3. **Record the number of comparisons required for each permutation**.  
4. **Identify best-case, worst-case, and average-case performance**.  

This experiment demonstrates how input order **affects sorting complexity**, reinforcing the importance of choosing efficient algorithms for larger datasets.  

---

## 🔬 Research & Explanation  
### **🔹 What is Bubble Sort?**  
Bubble Sort is a **comparison-based sorting algorithm** that repeatedly **swaps adjacent elements** until the list is sorted.  
- **Best-case scenario**: The list is **already sorted**, requiring minimal comparisons.  
- **Worst-case scenario**: The list is **reverse sorted**, requiring maximum comparisons.  
- **Average-case scenario**: The list is randomly shuffled, requiring varying comparisons.  

### **🔹 Why Count Comparisons Instead of Swaps?**  
- **Comparisons** reflect the **computational complexity** of sorting.  
- **Swaps depend on implementation**, but comparisons provide a **consistent metric** for evaluating efficiency.  

### **🔹 Expected Bubble Sort Complexity**  
| **Case**        | **Number of Comparisons** | **Time Complexity** |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Best Case** (Already Sorted) | **4** | **O(n)** |
| **Worst Case** (Reverse Sorted) | **10** | **O(n²)** |
| **Average Case** (Random Order) | **~9.26** | **O(n²)** |

---

## 📜 Implementation  
### ✅ Steps to Implement the Task  
1️⃣ **Generate all permutations** of `[1,2,3,4,5]`.  
2️⃣ **Implement Bubble Sort** with a **comparison counter**.  
3️⃣ **Apply Bubble Sort to each permutation** and record the **number of comparisons**.  
4️⃣ **Summarise results**, identifying best, worst, and average cases.  

---

## 📝 Alternative Approaches  

| **Sorting Algorithm** | **Time Complexity** | **Best Used For** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Bubble Sort (Used Here)** | \(O(n^2)\) | Small lists, educational purposes | Simple, easy to implement | Very slow for large inputs |
| **Insertion Sort** | \(O(n^2)\) | Partially sorted lists | Efficient for small or nearly sorted lists | Slow for large inputs |
| **Merge Sort** | \(O(n \log n)\) | Large datasets, stable sorting | Always efficient, stable | Requires additional space |
| **Quick Sort** | \(O(n \log n)\) | Large datasets, quick sorting | Very fast, works well in practice | Worst-case is \(O(n^2)\) |

✅ **Conclusion:**  
Bubble Sort is useful for **understanding sorting complexity**, but **inefficient for large datasets**.  
This experiment highlights why more advanced sorting algorithms (e.g., **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**) are preferable for practical applications.
