    "## Why use `31` and `101` ?  \n",
    "The hash function in the C code follow a common pattern in hashing, using **prime numbers** to reduce collisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why `31`?** \n",
    "- **Prime number**: Helps distribute hash value **evenly** across a range.  \n",
    "- **Efficient multiplication**:  `31` can be computed as ``(x << 5) - x`` (bit shift and subtraction).  \n",
    "- **Commonly used in string hashing** (e.g., Java uses `31` in it's `hashCode()` function).   \n",
    "-  In Java, `31` is chosen as a multiplier in string hashing due to its prime properties and efficient computation.  \n",
    "For further discussion, see:  \n",
    "[GeeksforGeeks – Why Does Java’s `hashCode` Use 31?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-hashcode-method-in-java/)  \n",
    "- For an explanation of why `31` is commonly used in hashing, see:  \n",

    "\n",
    " \n",
    "### **Why `101`?**  \n",
    "- **Prime modulus**: Helps ensure a more uniform distribution of hash values.  \n",
    "- **Prevents excessive collisions**: if `101` were a power of 2, the hash function might cause clustering.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus `31` and `101` work together to create an **efficient and well-distributed** hash function.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Justification of choice  \n",
    "The **Miller-Rabin primality test** is a probabilistic algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It is based on the properties of **strong pseudoprimes** and is highly efficient for large numbers. Although it is used primarily with large prime numbers, I found the algorithm pretty interesting and I also felt it was different to standard algorithms. I'm aware it is a probabilistic algorithm which means it is not ideal for generating the first 100 prime numbers because it is a **probabilistic** test, not a **deterministic** method for listing primes. I know  it is not designed for sequential prime generation. I was interested to see if I could get it working. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:  \n",
    "1. **Decompose `n`:** Write `n` as `d * 2^r + 1`, where `d` is odd.  \n",
    "2. **Choose Bases:** Select a set of bases (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.) for testing.  \n",
    "3. **Check Composite:** For each base, check if it satisfies certain conditions that imply `n` is composite.  \n",
    "4. **Repeat:** Perform the test `k` times to reduce the probability of error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:  \n",
    "- **Efficient:** Works well for large numbers.  \n",
    "- **Probabilistic:** Can be made deterministic for numbers less than 2^64.  \n",

    "#### Disadvantages:  \n",
    "- **Probabilistic:** Small chance of false positives (though negligible for practical purposes).    \n",

    "   - If `n` is even, return `False` (not prime).\n",

    "2. **Decompose `n`:**\n",
    "   - Write `n` as `n = 2^r * d + 1`, where `d` is odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choose Bases:**\n",
    "   - For numbers ≤ 2^64, use a deterministic set of bases (2, 3, 5, etc.).\n",
    "   - For larger numbers, use `k` random bases.\n",

    "4. **Check Composite:**\n",
    "   - For each base, check if `n` is composite using the `check_composite` function.\n",
    "   - If `n` is composite for any base, return `False`.\n",
    "   - If `n` passes all tests, return `True` (likely prime)."

    "The function should:  \n",

    "3. **Extract the fractional part** (i.e., the part after the decimal point).  \n",

    "- The **first 100 primes are reused from Task 4**, ensuring efficiency.    \n",
    "- The **fractional part** is extracted using standard floating-point operations.  \n",

    "In the **worst-case scenario**, where the list is in **descending order**, Bubble Sort performs the **maximum number of comparisons**. The number of comparisons follows the formula:  \n",
    "\n",

    "In the **best-case scenario**, where the list is **already sorted**, Bubble Sort **exits early** due to no swaps occurring.  \n",
