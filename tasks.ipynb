    "### **Why `31`?** \n",
    "- **Prime number**: Helps distribute hash value **evenly** across a range.  \n",
    "- **Efficient multiplication**:  `31` can be computed as ``(x << 5) - x`` (bit shift and subtraction).  \n",
    "- **Commonly used in string hashing** (e.g., Java uses `31` in it's `hashCode()` function).   \n",

    " \n",
    "### **Why `101`?**  \n",
    "- **Prime modulus**: Helps ensure a more uniform distribution of hash values.  \n",
    "- **Prevents excessive collisions**: if `101` were a power of 2, the hash function might cause clustering.  \n",

    "### 🔹 Algorithm 1: Miller-Rabin Primality Test  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification of choice  \n",
    "The **Miller-Rabin primality test** is a probabilistic algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It is based on the properties of **strong pseudoprimes** and is highly efficient for large numbers. Although it is used primarily with large prime numbers, I found the algorithm pretty interesting and I also felt it was different to standard algorithms. I'm aware it is a probabilistic algorithm which means it is not ideal for generating the first 100 prime numbers because it is a **probabilistic** test, not a **deterministic** method for listing primes. I know  it is not designed for sequential prime generation. I was interested to see if I could get it working. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:  \n",
    "1. **Decompose `n`:** Write `n` as `d * 2^r + 1`, where `d` is odd.  \n",
    "2. **Choose Bases:** Select a set of bases (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.) for testing.  \n",
    "3. **Check Composite:** For each base, check if it satisfies certain conditions that imply `n` is composite.  \n",
    "4. **Repeat:** Perform the test `k` times to reduce the probability of error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:  \n",
    "- **Efficient:** Works well for large numbers.  \n",
    "- **Probabilistic:** Can be made deterministic for numbers less than 2^64.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:  \n",
    "- **Probabilistic:** Small chance of false positives (though negligible for practical purposes).    \n",

    "#### 🛠 Function Description\n",
    "####  `miller_rabin(n, k=5)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Purpose\n",
    "This function performs the **Miller-Rabin primality test** to determine if a number `n` is prime. It’s a probabilistic test but can be made deterministic for numbers less than 2^64.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 🔹 Steps\n",
    "1. **Handle Edge Cases:**\n",
    "   - If `n < 2`, return `False` (not prime).\n",
    "   - If `n` is 2 or 3, return `True` (prime).\n",
    "   - If `n` is even, return `False` (not prime).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decompose `n`:**\n",
    "   - Write `n` as `n = 2^r * d + 1`, where `d` is odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choose Bases:**\n",
    "   - For numbers ≤ 2^64, use a deterministic set of bases (2, 3, 5, etc.).\n",
    "   - For larger numbers, use `k` random bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check Composite:**\n",
    "   - For each base, check if `n` is composite using the `check_composite` function.\n",
    "   - If `n` is composite for any base, return `False`.\n",
    "   - If `n` passes all tests, return `True` (likely prime).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "The Miller-Rabin test is based on **Fermat's Little Theorem**, which states that if `p` is prime and `a` is not divisible by `p`, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The test extends this by checking for non-trivial square roots of 1 modulo `n`. For a prime number, the only square roots of 1 are +1 and -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on Fermat's Little Theorem, see:\n",
    "- [Stanford Number Theory Course Notes](https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/numbertheory/fermat.html)\n",
    "- [AMS: Fermat's Little Theorem and Generalizations](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1979-01-05/S0273-0979-1979-14701-X/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:  \n",
    "- **Efficient:** Works well for large numbers.  \n",
    "- **Probabilistic:** Can be made deterministic for numbers less than 2^64.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:  \n",
    "- **Probabilistic:** Small chance of false positives (though negligible for practical purposes). "

    "The **square root optimisation** is a deterministic method for checking primality. It works by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. I chose this for its simplicity and efficiency. It provides a definite answer (no probabilistic uncertainty) and is efficient for small numbers. **In our notes** you can see this:\n",

    "3.The algorithm is straight forward to implement and understand    \n",
    "\n",
    "**How I adapted it**  \n",
    "1. Skipping Even Numbers After 2 – Since all even numbers (except 2) are non-prime, we skip them, reducing unnecessary computations.    \n",
    "2. More Efficient Prime Generation – When generating the first n primes, we check divisibility only for previously found primes, avoiding redundant checks  \n",

    "- **Task 2:** Verifies K&R hash outputs for sample strings.\n",
    "- **Task 3:** Confirms SHA-256 padding for a file containing `\"abc\"`, including correct 64-bit length encoding.\n",
    "- **Task 4:** Checks prime detection and generation functions.\n",
    "- **Task 5:** Validates the extraction of fractional root bits (used in SHA-like constants).\n",
    "- **Task 6:** Tests SHA-256 hash leading zero detection and dictionary word validation.\n",
    "- **Task 7:** Ensures the Turing machine correctly increments binary numbers.\n",
    "- **Task 8:** Counts comparisons in bubble sort for best and worst-case permutations.\n",
